Below are few metrics which will be interested to monitor in this case.

CPU Utilization: Its important to monitor the CPU utilization of each of the 4 CPUs to detect any potential performance issue that ay occur if any of the CPU are overloaded.

Memory usage: Monitoring memory usage is important to make sure that server has enough memory available to handle the high volume of requests.

Disk space usage: Monitoring the disk usage is also importnat to make sure that server has enough space available otherwise servers running out of space might cause application to crash and go down.

Network traffic: Monitoring the network traffic is important to identify the congestion of network.

SSL handshake times: Monitoring SSL handshake times is  important to ensure that the SSL offloading is not cuasing the delays in request processing.


To monitor these metrics we can use monitoring tool such as Dynatrace. Dynatrace is a comprehensive monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into application performance and infrastructure monitoring.
Dynatrace has the capability to monitor all the metrics listed above.

Challenges in monitoring this server include the high volume of requests being processed, which can generate a large amout of performance data to be collected and analyzed. So its impertant to setup the monitoring environment to capture only the required metrics.
Also as Dynatrace is a commercial tool and can be expensive so chossing a right tool for this might be challenging job but yeah it depends on the budget otherwise we can go with open-source monitoring tools Nagios.
